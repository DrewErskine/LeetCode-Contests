> **How to Use the Template**

2. **Navigate to the Template Folder**:
   ```
   cd competitionTemplate
   ```

3. **Customize the Template**:
   - Update `Solution1.java`, `Solution2.java`, etc., with your solutions.
   - Write your tests in `TestSolutions.java`.

4. **Build the Project** (Requires Maven):
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run Tests**:
   ```
   mvn test
   ```
